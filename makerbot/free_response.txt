The four somewhat-technical questions asked in an initial phone interview with the 
VP of software at MakerBot

-Difference between a class and an object?
-Example of a time you used inheritance?
-What is MVC? What's a view?
-Why the need for both Fixnum and Bignum in Ruby? How big can  Bignums get?
